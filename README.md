# Kaggle-Multiclass-Obesity
Simple kaggle challenge for fun


The idea is to compete in the kaggle challenge [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2/overview).

Here are a few things to consider:

1. **Data understanding, Data Quality Assessment:** Investigate the data, look for outliers, missing data, and stuff that is suspicious
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Imputation, one-hot encodings, normalization
3. **Classifier**: Implementation of a classifier of choice and train it (also includes hyperparameter exploration)
4. **Evaluation:** Put outputs into submission format (denormalization), verify results, upload submission and get score
